# force-controlled-motion

Authors: Jonathan Zwiebel, Joseph Rummelhart

This goal of this project is to provide a framework for simulating control code under the constraints of Newtonian (force-controlled) motion. The current state of the project includes frameworks for multiple forces (ex. v-proportional, gravitational) as well as a simulator to apply those forces to a single point mass. Time, position, velocity, and acceleration values are output to CSVs. Additionally there are forces to simulate the effect of various PID control loops.
